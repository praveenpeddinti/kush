                            <p>
                                With a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Osmania University and as a software developer by training I moved to the US nearly 20 years back. Since then I have cofounded couple of successful startups and I have managed, architected and developed various enterprise level solutions and software applications for some of the well known Retail, Shipping, Telecom, Insurance and financial companies. With Kushghar, I want to bring to India the professionalism, accountability and respect for human life that I see around me. For professionals like me, time is at the highest premium. If someone provides me a quality service where I do not have to supervise or worry, I can spend that time with my family or the things that really matter to me. With the changing demographics of Indian cities, I realized two things during my visits home. There is a crying need for high quality home services, and the skillset available for these services do not come close to the expectations of the new-age Indian professional. This is how Kushghar was born.

                            <p>With a degree in Computer Science and an MBA, both from Indiana University, I have co-founded a number of startups as well as worked for some of the biggest names in the US in the last three decades. I often thought about what I could do to help people – not just giving them what they need today – but to have a better life in the long run. Kushghar, for me, is an opportunity to impact families across the economic spectrum, to give people what they need to change their life and their kids’ lives. High quality, professional and safe home services to give families better and more time together, and an easily-taught science which provides a stable and respectable livelihood to our staff. This is our vision of making people’s lives better, one home at a time.  </p>

                            <p> I am a mechanical engineer from National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India. I have spent many years in senior management in manufacturing, marketing and sales, and pharmaceuticals before choosing the entrepreneurial route. I have promoted several successful businesses in healthcare services, data management, technology, and aerial imaging. Several of these companies are industry leaders and pioneers in terms of processes, quality systems, and human resource practices. I have also launched a rural BPO in a village in Andhra Pradesh with 50 executives working as per US quality and security parameters. KushGhar is my contribution to bringing high-quality home services to the Indian market. My commitment to KushGhar is also driven by my desire to organize and improve the conditions and practices in the home services segment. </p>
